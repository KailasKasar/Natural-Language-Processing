# Natural Language Processing
Natural Language Processing (or NLP) is applying Machine Learning algorithms to words and phrases.
Using Natural Language Processing we are teaching machines to understand what is said in spoken and written word. 

#Wikipedia definition for NLP

Natural language processing (NLP) is a subfield of computer science, information engineering, 
and artificial intelligence concerned with the interactions between computers and human (natural) languages,
in particular how to program computers to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data.

In this project I am using NLP algorithm to classify dataset SMS message as spam or not spam.

Machine Learning models like Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, CART are best used for classification problem.

#Naive Bayes
I am using Naive Bayes model that can classify dataset SMS messages as spam or not spam.
Dataset used for this project is available on UCI machine learning repository https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/SMS+Spam+Collection.
Bayes theorem calculates the probability of a certain event happening(message being spam)
based on the joint probabilistic distributions of certain other events(a message being classified as spam).


# Importing the libraries
import pandas as pd

# Importing the dataset
dataset = pd.read_table('SMSSpamCollection', sep='\t', 
                   header=None, 
                   names=['label', 'sms_message'])

dataset['label'] = dataset.label.map({'ham':0, 'spam':1})
# Cleaning the texts
import re
from nltk.corpus import stopwords
from nltk.stem.porter import PorterStemmer
bag = []
for i in range(0, 5572):
    msg = re.sub('[^a-zA-Z]', ' ', dataset['sms_message'][i])
    msg = msg.lower()
    msg = msg.split()
    ps = PorterStemmer()
    msg = [ps.stem(word) for word in msg if not word in set(stopwords.words('english'))]
    msg = ' '.join(msg)
    bag.append(msg)

# Creating the Bag of Words model
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer
cv = CountVectorizer(max_features = 5000)
X = cv.fit_transform(bag).toarray()
y = dataset['label'].values

# Splitting the dataset into the Training set and Test set
from sklearn.cross_validation import train_test_split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size = 0.20, random_state = 0)

# Fitting Naive Bayes to the Training set

from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB
classifier = MultinomialNB()
classifier.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predicting the Test set results
y_pred = classifier.predict(X_test)

# Making the Confusion Matrix
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix
cm = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred)
